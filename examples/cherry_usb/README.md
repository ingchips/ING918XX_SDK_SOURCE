# CherryUsb Example

This project is an implementation of the CherryUSB stack on the ING916 series chip.

It demonstrates how to enable both USB host and USB device functionality simultaneously
on a single embedded device.

## NOTE:

- **This project only supports Keil5**
- **If CherryUSB is used in host mode, it has large requirements for stack and memory. Attention should be paid to whether the heap can meet these requirements.**
