# BQB RF Test App

This is a customizable BQB RF test app. It parses HCI commands from UART, calls GAP APIs, and sends
results to UART. This app uses the default UART for HCI transmission, supports BLE test mode, and CW test.

Recent releases of BLE Core Spec added new variants of test commands. A simple summary:

* **HCI_LE_Receiver_Test_v2**: Support different PHYs and modulation indices;
* **HCI_LE_Receiver_Test_v3**: CTE;
* **HCI_LE_Transmitter_Test_v2**: Support different PHYs;
* **HCI_LE_Transmitter_Test_v3**: CTE;
* **HCI_LE_Transmitter_Test_v4**: Change Tx power.

For ING916xx, this app also demonstrates how to tune frequency offset.

## Customization

1. UART configuration

    Update `config_uart` to configure UART.

1. Power Mode

    Power mode can be adjusted by RF Test Tool after connected:

## Testing

1. BLE Tester

    Connect HCI-UART to testers and do the test as usual.

1. Self Test

    Download this example to two dev-boards, and use two RF Test Tool to control two boards: let one
    as transmitter and the other as receiver.

1. Frequency Offset Tunning (ING916xx only)

    1. Download this example to a device (or dev-board);
    2. Start Frequency Offset Tester (another ING918xx dev-board is required);
    3. Use RF Test Tool to control ING916xx device to send test signal
       at the same frequency with Frequency Offset Tester;
    4. Adjust the "Tune" value in RF Test Tool and check frequency offset
       in Frequency Offset Tester.
