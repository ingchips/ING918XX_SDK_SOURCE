# Peripheral LED & CTE

This example is threefold:

* a RGB LED that can be controlled by _ING BLE_
* a CTE responder in connection mode
* Proprietary connection-less AoA

## Hardware Setup

* ING918xx Dev-Board: Marked jumpers should be connected:

## Test

Download the this example. Then test each function:

* RGB LED: The on-board LED goes between dim and bright when unconnected.

    Connect with _ING BLE_ to the device, and modify its RGB components.

* CTE responder in connection mode: Ref to [_Central CTE_](../../central_cte/doc/index.md)
    without `PRO_MODE`.

* Proprietary connection-less AoA: Ref to [_Central CTE_](../../central_cte/doc/index.md) with `PRO_MODE`.


##  RGB_LED Support

At present, the program supports two LED light drivers (TLC59731 and WS2881), which can be adapted to two different LED lights by defining macro RGB_LED to following valuesï¼š
```
#define LED_TLC59731    0
#define LED_WS2881      1
```
