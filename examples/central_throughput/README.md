# Central Throughput

This example demonstrates how to:

* Use central (master) role to:
    * Scan & connect to peripheral devices;
    * Discovery services & characteristics defined by 128bit UUID;
    * Get notification when characteristics value updated;
    * Write to characteristics value.

Note: This example works with `peripheral_throughput`.
