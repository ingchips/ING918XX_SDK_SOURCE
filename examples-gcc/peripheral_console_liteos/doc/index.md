# Peripheral Console (LiteOS-M)

This example is the same as [Keil version](../../../examples/peripheral_console/doc/index.md) of this example,
except that the RTOS ([LiteOS-M](https://github.com/openharmony/kernel_liteos_m)) is within the app but not the platform, and `EXT_INT` key event report is not available, either.
